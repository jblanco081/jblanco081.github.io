            <h3>Software Design and Engineering Enhancement</h3>
            <p>Expanded the Minecraft Clone by improving modularity, memory efficiency, and rendering performance. Implemented object-oriented programming principles to separate rendering, physics, and input handling. Optimized chunk generation by implementing lazy loading techniques and refactored rendering loops for better efficiency.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h3>Algorithms and Data Structure Enhancement</h3>
            <p>Optimized chunk rendering using spatial partitioning and Quadtrees to improve performance. Implemented an efficient chunk management system that dynamically loads and unloads chunks based on player position. Applied Quadtrees for spatial partitioning and optimized raycasting algorithms for block selection.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h3>Database Artifact Enhancement</h3>
            <p>Implemented a structured inventory database to track player items efficiently. Designed an inventory database schema for fast retrieval and updates of inventory. Ensured data integrity and security to prevent duplication or loss of items. Improved database security by using prepared statements and access control.</p>

        <h2>Code Review Video</h2>
        <p>My code review video provides an in-depth walkthrough of my original Minecraft Clone project before enhancements were made. The video focuses on the existing structure, early challenges, and planned improvements.</p>
        <p>Key Discussion Points in Code Review:</p>
        <ul>
            -Existing Functionality: The original project was a basic rendering engine that allowed for a movable camera around a static 3D scene. The scene contained a desk setup, and blocks were not dynamically placed or removed.
            -Code Analysis: The initial code was well-structured but lacked the mechanics needed for a true voxel-based game. The rendering pipeline was simple, and no chunk system existed to manage large-scale block environments.
            -Planned Enhancements: My main focus was to introduce chunk management, efficient block storage, and an inventory system. This required restructuring the rendering system to support dynamically generated terrain and integrating database-backed inventory management.
